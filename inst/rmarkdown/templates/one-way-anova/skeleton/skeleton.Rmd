# Analysis Framework

    1. Load the Data
    
    2. Understand the data (Distribution, Variability, Outliers)
      * Summary Statistics
      * Data Visualization
      * Outliers
    
    3. Check Assumptions
      * Normality of Residuals or DV by group
      * Homogeneity (Equality) of Variance or Sphericity
      * Independent Samples
      
    4. Conduct the Statistical Test
      * Run ANOVA
      
    5. Conduct Post-Hoc Analyses as needed
      * Pairwise *t*-tests
      * One-Way ANOVAs
  
# One-Way ANOVA (Between-Subjects)

## 1. Load the Data

```{r load-data-a}
# Loading the Data
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins # Loads the dataset called 'penguins' from the palmerpengins package and assigns it the name "penguins"
?penguins # Loads the help menu giving some descriptive information for the dataset
glimpse(penguins) # Gives a quick view of the structure of the dataset.
```

Research Question: 
We are interested in determining if different species of penguins have different flipper lengths.  

What is the DV?
>

What is/are the IV(s)? How many levels do they have?
>

## 2. Understand the data (Distribution, Variability, Outliers)
  * Summary Statistics
```{r descriptive-stats-a}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(flipper_length_mm)
```

What are your observations given the descriptive statistics?
>

  * Data Visualization
```{r data-vis-a}
# Boxplot
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, width = .1)

# Continuous Density Plot
penguins %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_grid(species ~ .)
```

What are your observations (distribution, variability) given these data visualizations?
>

  * Outliers
```{r outliers-a}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  rstatix::identify_outliers(flipper_length_mm) # Produces a table of outliers and extreme cases.
```

Are there any outliers in these data?
> 

## 3. Check Assumptions
  * Normality of Residuals or DV by group


*a. Analyzing the ANOVA model residuals. This approach is generally easier to do and helpful if there are many groups. This is the approach we will take.*

```{r normality-a}
# Assumption testing- Normality of Residuals- QQ Plot
model <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
ggqqplot(residuals(model)) # Graphically depicts the correlation of these data and a normal distribution.

# Shapiro-Wilkes Test
shapiro_test(residuals(model)) # Statistically determines normality of these data.
```

*b. Checking Normality for each group separately. This might be helpful if you have only a few groups.*

```{r normality2-a}
# Assumption testing- Normality DV by groups

ggqqplot(penguins, "flipper_length_mm", facet.by = "species") # Graphically depicts the correlation of these data and a normal distribution.

# Shapiro-Wilkes Test
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  shapiro_test(flipper_length_mm) # Statistically determines normality of these data. 
```
*Note: may be overly sensitive if data is more than 50. In that case, the qq plot is preferred.*

Are these data normally distributed?
>

*If the data are not normally distributed, a Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric alternative to the One-Way ANOVA.*

  * Homogeneity (Equality) of Variance
```{r variance-a}
# Residuals vs Fitted Plot
plot(model, 1) # Graphically compares the residuals to fitted values (mean of each group)

# Assumption testing- Homogeneity of Variance
penguins %>% levene_test(flipper_length_mm ~ species) # Statistically shows homogeneity of variance.
```
*If the data do not have homogeneity of variance, a welch one way ANOVA test can be performed (`welch_anova_test()`)*

Do these data meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance?
>

  * Independent Samples

Are these independent samples?
>


## 4. Conduct the Statistical Test
  * Run ANOVA
```{r ANOVA-a}
# One-Way ANOVA- Tests of Between-Subject with equal variance
penguins %>% 
  anova_test(flipper_length_mm ~ species)
```
Interpret the results
>

## 5. Conduct Post-Hoc Analyses as needed
  * Pairwise *t*-tests
```{r pairwise-t-test-a}
penguins %>% 
  pairwise_t_test(flipper_length_mm ~ species)
```
Interpret the results
>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One-Way Repeated-Measures ANOVA (Within-Subjects)

## 1. Load the Data

```{r load-data-b}
# Loading the Data
grit <- pl462::grit # Loads the dataset called 'grit' from the pl462 package and assigns it the name "penguins"
?grit # Loads the help menu giving some descriptive information for the dataset
glimpse(grit) # Gives a quick view of the structure of the dataset.
```

Research Question: 
We are interested in determining whether grit changes based on when the measure is taken (matriculation, freshmen year, sophmore year) 

What is the DV?
>

What is/are the IV(s)? How many levels do they have?
>

## 2. Understand the data (Distribution, Variability, Outliers)
  * Summary Statistics
```{r descriptive-stats-b}
grit %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(grit)
```

What are your observations given the descriptive statistics?
>

  * Data Visualization
```{r data-vis-b}
# Boxplot
grit %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = class, y = grit) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, width = .1)

# Continuous Density Plot
grit %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(x = grit, fill = class) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_grid(class ~ .)
```

What are your observations (distribution, variability) given these data visualizations?
>

  * Outliers
```{r outliers-b}
grit %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  rstatix::identify_outliers(grit) # Produces a table of outliers and extreme cases.
```

Are there any outliers in these data?
> 

## 3. Check Assumptions
  * Normality of Residuals or DV by group


*a. Analyzing the ANOVA model residuals. This approach is generally easier to do and helpful if there are many groups. This is the approach we will take.*

```{r normality-b}
# Assumption testing- Normality of Residuals- QQ Plot
model <- lm(grit ~ class, data = grit)
ggqqplot(residuals(model)) # Graphically depicts the correlation of these data and a normal distribution.

# Shapiro-Wilkes Test
shapiro_test(residuals(model)) # Statistically determines normality of these data.
```

*b. Checking Normality for each group separately. This might be helpful if you have only a few groups.*

```{r normality2-b}
# Assumption testing- Normality DV by groups

ggqqplot(grit, "grit", facet.by = "class") # Graphically depicts the correlation of these data and a normal distribution.

# Shapiro-Wilkes Test
grit %>%
  group_by(class) %>%
  shapiro_test(grit) # Statistically determines normality of these data. 
```
*Note: may be overly sensitive if data is more than 50. In that case, the qq plot is preferred.*

Are these data normally distributed?
>

*If the data are not normally distributed, a Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric alternative to the One-Way ANOVA (`kruskal_test()`).*

  * Sphericity
*variance of the differences between groups should be equal. This can be checked using the Mauchlyâ€™s test of sphericity. This is automatically reported and adjusted with `anova_test()`*

## 4. Conduct the Statistical Test
  * Run ANOVA
```{r ANOVA-b}
# One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA- Tests of Within-Subject.
grit %>% 
  anova_test(wid = id, dv = grit, within = class)
```
Interpret the results
>

## 5. Conduct Post-Hoc Analyses as needed
  * Pairwise *t*-tests
```{r pairwise-t-test-b}
grit %>% 
  pairwise_t_test(grit ~ class,
                  paired = TRUE)
```
Interpret the results
