Today we will finally discuss Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.

# Analysis Framework

    1. Load the Data
    
    2. Understand the data (Distribution, Variability, Outliers)
      * Summary Statistics
      * Data Visualization
      * Outliers
    
    3. Check Assumptions
      * Normality of Residuals
      * Homoskedasticity
      * Independent Observations
      * Linear Relationship
      * Continuous variables

    4. Conduct the Statistical Test
      * Run Linear Regression `lm()`
      
    5. Conduct Post-Hoc Analyses as needed
  
# Multiple Regression

## 1. Load the Data

```{r load-data-a}
# Loading the Data
dat <- pl462::happyparent %>% 
 select(sex, str_slf1, negmood1, health)# Loads the dataset called 'happyparent' from the pl462 package and assigns it the name "dat"
?happyparent # Loads the help menu giving some descriptive information for the dataset
glimpse(dat) # Gives a quick view of the structure of the dataset.
```

Research Question: 
How are stress regarding self, self-rated physical health, and sex related to negative mood?

What is our DV?

What are our IVs?

## 2. Understand the data (Distribution, Variability, Outliers)
  * Summary Statistics
```{r descriptive-stats-a}
dat %>% 
  skimr::skim()
```

What are your observations given the descriptive statistics?

>

  * Data Visualization
```{r data-vis-a}
p1 <- dat %>%
  ggplot() +
    aes(x = health) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 5) +
    labs(title = "Histogram of Self-Reported Health")
p2 <- dat %>%
  ggplot() +
    aes(x = str_slf1) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 9) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Self-Reported Stress",
       x = "stress",
       y = "")
p3 <- dat %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = sex) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count", bins = 2) +
  labs(title = "Number of participants according to Sex")
p4 <- dat %>%
  ggplot() +
    aes(x = negmood1) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Self-Reported Negative Mood",
       x = "negative mood",
       caption = "Higher score = more positive mood")

(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4)
```

  * Correlations
```{r}
dat %>%
  select(-sex) %>%
  cor_mat() %>%
  cor_mark_significant(cutpoints = c(0, .001, .01, .05, 1),
                       symbols = c("***", "**", "*", ""))
```

What are your observations (distribution and correlations)?

>

  * Outliers
```{r outliers-a}
dat %>% 
  rstatix::identify_outliers(negmood1) # Produces a table of outliers and extreme cases.
```

Are there any outliers in these data?

> 

## 3. Check Assumptions
  * Normality of Residuals

```{r normality-a}
# Assumption testing- Normality of Residuals- QQ Plot
model <- lm(negmood1 ~ sex + str_slf1 + health, 
            data = dat)
ggqqplot(residuals(model)) # Graphically depicts the correlation of these data and a normal distribution.

# Shapiro-Wilkes Test
shapiro_test(residuals(model)) # Statistically determines normality of these data.

# With outliers removed
model2 <- lm(negmood1 ~ sex + str_slf1 + health, 
             data = dat %>% 
               filter(!is_extreme(negmood1)))
ggqqplot(residuals(model2))
shapiro_test(residuals(model2))
```

Are these residuals normally distributed?

>

  * Homoskedasticity
```{r variance-a}
# Residuals vs Fitted Plot
plot(model2, 1)# Graphically compares the residuals to fitted values 
```
*If the data has homoskedasticity, the points should be equally dispursed away from the line as you move from one side to the other. If the points resemble more of a sideways "V", you have heteroskedasticity and you would need to find a way to correct for that (Box-Cox transformation)

Do these data meet the assumption of homoskedasticity?

>


## 4. Conduct the Statistical Test
  * Run linear regression
```{r lm-a}
# We've already run the linear regression above. Now to see the results: 
summary(model2)
```
Interpret the output?

What is the predicted mood score for a woman with 5 stressors and a self-rated health score of 3?

> Å¶ = Intercept - b(stress-self) + b(health) - b(gender)

  * Find standardized regression coefficients for reporting
```{r}
summary(lm.beta(model2), standardized = TRUE)
```
