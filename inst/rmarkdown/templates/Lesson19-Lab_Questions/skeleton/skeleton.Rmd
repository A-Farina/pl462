# Comment on the normality of the data:

### A. Distribution



### B.	Variance



### C.	Outliers

# ANOVA Questions:

### 1. What are the independent variables and how many levels do they have?



### 2. What is the dependent variable?



### 3. Describe the assumption of homogeneity of variance. Has the assumption been met? (Quote relevant statistics in APA format).



### 4. Report the main effect of Type of Therapy in APA format. Is this effect significant and how would you interpret it?



### 5. Report the main effect of Time in Therapy in APA format. Is this effect significant and how would you interpret it?



### 6. Report the interaction effect between Therapy and AmtTher in APA format. Is this effect significant and how would you interpret it?
